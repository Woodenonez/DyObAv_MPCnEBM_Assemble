'''
Description:
    All standard commonly-used objects are defined here.
    Each object should be defined strictly with data type hints.
    Each object should have some basic functions (such as __call__, __getitem__, etc.).
    The functions are just designed for Python though!
Comment:
    Python native float is float64 (double float).
    Python list is like C++ array.
